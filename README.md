# Changes Based on Lecturer's Feedback:
Improved UI Layout: Adjusted the layout of the MainWindow.xaml to ensure a more user-friendly interface. Added grid definitions for better organization of elements and improved button placement for intuitive navigation.
I enhanced the IngredientWindow.xaml and StepWindow.xaml to include proper data validation and user feedback messages, ensuring that all necessary fields are filled correctly.
Even added robust error handling in the MainWindow.xaml.cs to manage invalid inputs and provide informative messages to the user, thereby improving the overall user experience.
Improved the filtering functionalities for ingredients, food groups, and calories, ensuring that the filters work correctly and display relevant results in the ListBox.
